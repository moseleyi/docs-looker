# Data Table

### _Show TOP N Rows_

If you want to display **TOP N** in your **table** visualisation, make sure you order them by your desired measure and then navigate to **Visualisation Settings** --> **Limit Displayed Rows** --> **Show First 15**Your data table will still include **all the results** but the visualisation itself will be limited. This can allow you to do **% of All** because your calculations still have the whole table in context :)
